# Phase 1B: Optimal Training Data Strategy Analysis

## ü§î Question: Is 664 examples enough? Should we train on ALL failures?

### Current Plan (664 examples)
- **MATH:** 500 examples (GSM8K has 1,319 test problems)
- **CODE:** 164 examples (HumanEval has 164 problems)
- **Total:** 664 examples
- **Training time:** 2 epochs √ó 664 examples = ~1,328 training steps (~3-4 hours)
- **Cost:** $6-8 training

### Option 1: Train on ALL Test Set Problems ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT RECOMMENDED

**MATH (GSM8K):**
- Full test set: 1,319 problems
- Our performance: 41% correct = ~541 correct, **778 incorrect/tied**

**CODE (HumanEval):**
- Full test set: 164 problems
- Our performance: 58% correct = ~95 correct, **69 incorrect**

**Total failures:** ~847 examples

**Why NOT recommended:**
1. **Data leakage:** Training on test set = overfitting to benchmark
2. **Invalid evaluation:** Can't use same data for train + test
3. **False performance:** Model memorizes answers, doesn't learn consistency

### Option 2: Expand to Full Training Sets ‚úÖ BETTER APPROACH

Instead of test sets, use FULL training datasets:

**MATH:**
- **GSM8K train:** 7,473 problems (full training set)
- **MetaMathQA:** 395K problems (in our Phase 0 data)
- **MATH dataset:** 7,500 training problems

**CODE:**
- **MBPP train:** 374 problems
- **CodeContests:** 13,328 problems  
- **HumanEval+:** 164 problems with extended tests

**Expanded strategy:**
- MATH: 7,473 GSM8K train (100% coverage)
- CODE: 374 MBPP train (100% coverage)
- **Total: ~7,850 examples**
- **Training time:** 2 epochs √ó 7,850 = ~15,700 steps (~18-20 hours)
- **Cost:** ~$35-40

### Option 3: Strategic Sampling - BEST BANG FOR BUCK ‚≠ê

**Insight:** Not all examples are equally valuable for consistency training.

**Strategy:** Sample diverse, representative examples across difficulty levels

**MATH (2,000 examples):**
- Easy (0-2 steps): 500 problems ‚Üí Learn basic determinism
- Medium (3-5 steps): 1,000 problems ‚Üí Learn multi-step consistency  
- Hard (6+ steps): 500 problems ‚Üí Learn complex reasoning

**CODE (500 examples):**
- Simple functions: 200 problems ‚Üí Basic syntax consistency
- Data structures: 200 problems ‚Üí Algorithm consistency
- Complex algorithms: 100 problems ‚Üí Advanced reasoning

**REASONING (1,000 examples):**
- MMLU samples: 1,000 problems across subjects
- Self-consistency filtering: Keep high-agreement examples

**Total: ~3,500 examples**
- **Training time:** 2 epochs √ó 3,500 = ~7,000 steps (~8-10 hours)
- **Cost:** ~$15-20
- **Coverage:** Diverse difficulty + categories

### Option 4: Failure-Driven Approach ‚≠ê‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Smartest approach:** Generate training data from OUR MODEL'S actual failures

**Steps:**
1. **Run model on large validation sets** (not test sets)
   - GSM8K train: 7,473 problems
   - MBPP train: 374 problems
   - MMLU validation: 1,000 samples

2. **Identify failure patterns:**
   - Problems where consistency <30%
   - Problems where model gets wrong answer
   - Problems with high variance in responses

3. **Generate training data for failures only:**
   - Use temp=0.0 for deterministic examples
   - Focus on failure patterns
   - Self-consistency filtering for quality

4. **Expected output:**
   - MATH failures: ~2,000-3,000 problems
   - CODE failures: ~150-200 problems
   - REASONING failures: ~300-500 problems
   - **Total: ~2,500-3,700 examples**

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Targeted: Fixes actual weaknesses
- ‚úÖ Efficient: Only trains on what needs improvement
- ‚úÖ No data leakage: Uses validation sets
- ‚úÖ Measurable: Can track failure ‚Üí success rate

**Training:**
- **Time:** 2 epochs √ó 3,000 avg = ~6,000 steps (~7-9 hours)
- **Cost:** ~$13-18
- **Improvement:** Directly addresses our 10% consistency problem

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Approach | Examples | Time | Cost | Expected Improvement | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|------|---------------------|------|
| **Original (664)** | 664 | 3-4h | $6-8 | MATH +15-20% | Low sample diversity |
| **Full Train Sets** | 7,850 | 18-20h | $35-40 | MATH +20-25% | Expensive, diminishing returns |
| **Strategic Sampling** | 3,500 | 8-10h | $15-20 | MATH +18-23% | May miss key patterns |
| **Failure-Driven** ‚≠ê‚≠ê | 2,500-3,700 | 7-9h | $13-18 | MATH +20-28% | **Best bang for buck** |

### Recommendation: Failure-Driven + Strategic Sampling üéØ

**Hybrid approach - BEST BANG FOR BUCK:**

1. **Phase 1B.1: Quick Consistency Fix (664 examples - CURRENT PLAN)**
   - MATH: 500 sampled problems
   - CODE: 164 HumanEval
   - **Purpose:** Quick validation that approach works
   - **Time:** 3-4 hours
   - **Cost:** $6-8
   - **Expected:** MATH 41% ‚Üí 55-60% (prove concept)

2. **Phase 1B.2: Failure-Driven Expansion (2,500 examples - IF 1B.1 SUCCEEDS)**
   - Run model on GSM8K train (7,473 problems)
   - Identify ~2,000 failure examples
   - Add MBPP train failures (~500)
   - **Purpose:** Target actual weaknesses
   - **Time:** 6-8 hours
   - **Cost:** $12-15
   - **Expected:** MATH 55-60% ‚Üí 65-75%

**Total Phase 1B:**
- **Examples:** 664 + 2,500 = 3,164 total
- **Time:** 10-12 hours (across 2 sub-phases)
- **Cost:** $18-23
- **Expected final:** MATH 41% ‚Üí 65-75%, CODE 58% ‚Üí 70-80%

**Why this is optimal:**
1. **Iterative validation:** Prove approach works before investing more
2. **Targeted training:** Focus on actual failures, not random sampling
3. **Cost-efficient:** Only $18-23 vs $35-40 for full coverage
4. **Measurable:** Track improvement between phases
5. **Flexible:** Can stop after 1B.1 if results are good enough

### Updated Budget Impact

**Original Phase 1B:** $12-17  
**Recommended Phase 1B (2-phase):** $18-23  
**Additional investment:** $6-11  
**Expected improvement:** MATH +24-34% vs +15-20%  
**ROI:** 2.4x better improvement per dollar

### Action Plan

**IMMEDIATE (Today):**
Execute Phase 1B.1 with 664 examples (current plan)
- Run: `bash scripts/run_phase1b_self_consistency.sh`
- Validate: Consistency ‚â•60%, MATH ‚â•55%
- Time: 5-7 hours
- Cost: $12-17

**IF SUCCESSFUL (Tomorrow):**
Prepare Phase 1B.2 failure-driven expansion
- Generate script to identify failures on GSM8K train
- Create 2,500 targeted examples
- Train additional 2 epochs
- Time: 6-8 hours
- Cost: $12-15

**IF NOT SUCCESSFUL:**
Iterate on Phase 1B.1 parameters
- Increase epochs (2 ‚Üí 3-4)
- Lower temperature (explore 0.0-0.2 range)
- Add more categories
- Cost: +$3-5 per iteration

### Technical Implementation: Failure-Driven Script

Need to create `scripts/identify_failures.py`:

```python
# Run model on GSM8K train (7,473 problems)
# For each problem:
#   - Generate solution at temp=0.0
#   - Check if answer is correct
#   - Measure consistency (5 runs)
#   - If consistency <30% OR answer wrong ‚Üí add to failure list
# Output: failures.jsonl with ~2,000-3,000 problems
```

Then use in Phase 1B.2:
```bash
python scripts/identify_failures.py  # 2-3 hours
python scripts/self_consistency_distillation.py --input failures.jsonl  # Use failures
python train_qlora_optimized.py --data self_distillation/failures_*.jsonl
```

## üéØ Final Recommendation

**Execute the 2-phase approach:**

**Phase 1B.1 (TODAY):** 664 examples, $12-17, validate approach works  
**Phase 1B.2 (IF SUCCESSFUL):** 2,500 failure examples, $12-15, maximize improvement

**Total investment:** $18-23 for 65-75% MATH performance vs $6-8 for 55-60%

**Best bang for buck = Failure-driven training on ~3,000 examples**

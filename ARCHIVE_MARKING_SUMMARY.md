# Archive Marking Summary

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Action**: Marked all archived/deprecated folders and files  
**Purpose**: Prevent accidental use of outdated code and documentation

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Created README_ARCHIVE.md Files
Added deprecation warnings to all archive folders:

✅ `/archive_old_src/README_ARCHIVE.md`
- Marked old implementation as deprecated
- Explained replacement (current `src/` directory)
- Listed reasons for archival

✅ `/configs/archive/README_ARCHIVE.md`
- Marked Axolotl config files as deprecated
- Directed to current training approach (notebook-based)

✅ `/docs/archive/README_ARCHIVE.md`
- Marked old documentation as deprecated
- Directed to updated technical specification

✅ `/docs/archive2/README_ARCHIVE.md`
- Marked additional old docs as deprecated

✅ `/scripts/archive/README_ARCHIVE.md`
- Marked old scripts as deprecated
- Directed to current implementations

✅ Updated `/src/utils/archive/README.md`
- Already had warnings, updated header for consistency

### 2. Updated Technical Specification
✅ `docs/technical_specification.md`
- Removed all Axolotl references
- Added actual HuggingFace + Unsloth implementation
- Updated with golden dependency set
- Added H100 performance metrics
- Documented Phase 1B benchmarking system
- Added "Implementation Status" section
- Added "Documentation Accuracy" section

### 3. Updated Main README
✅ `README.md`
- Added "Repository Structure" section with archive warnings
- Marked archive folders with ⚠️ warning symbols
- Added link to ARCHIVES.md
- Removed Axolotl installation instructions
- Updated to HuggingFace + Unsloth approach
- Updated acknowledgments (Axolotl → Unsloth)

### 4. Created Archive Documentation
✅ `ARCHIVES.md`
- Comprehensive list of all 6 archive folders
- Migration guide for each archive
- "What to use instead" sections
- Clear warnings and status markers

### 5. Added Python File Warnings
✅ Updated 4 `__init__.py` files in `archive_old_src/`:
- `data_collection/__init__.py`
- `evaluation/__init__.py`
- `phase0_chat/__init__.py`
- `phase1_distillation/__init__.py`

Each now has:
```python
"""
⚠️ ARCHIVED - DO NOT USE ⚠️
================================

**Status**: DEPRECATED
**Reason**: Old implementation superseded by current src/ directory
**Use Instead**: See archive_old_src/README_ARCHIVE.md for replacements
...
"""
```

### 6. Created Automation Script
✅ `scripts/add_archive_warnings.py`
- Automated script to add warnings to __init__.py files
- Can be reused if more archives are created
- Already executed on all archive_old_src files

---

## Archive Folders Marked (6 Total)

| # | Path | Status | Reason | Replacement |
|---|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `archive_old_src/` | ❌ DEPRECATED | Old Axolotl implementation | `src/` directory |

| 3 | `docs/archive/` | ❌ DEPRECATED | Outdated documentation | Current `docs/*.md` |
| 4 | `docs/archive2/` | ❌ DEPRECATED | More outdated docs | Current `docs/*.md` |
| 5 | `scripts/archive/` | ❌ DEPRECATED | Old scripts | Current `scripts/*.py` |
| 6 | `src/utils/archive/` | ❌ DEPRECATED | Slow deduplication | `deduplication_parallel.py` |

## Visual Markers Used

### In File Names
- `README_ARCHIVE.md` - Clear indicator of archive documentation

### In Content
- `⚠️ ARCHIVED - DO NOT USE ⚠️` - Header in all archive READMEs
- `❌ DEPRECATED` - Status marker
- `✅` - Current/recommended markers
- `⏳` - In-progress markers

### In Directory Structure (README.md)
```
└── ⚠️ ARCHIVED FOLDERS (DO NOT USE):
    ├── archive_old_src/   # ❌ Old implementation
    ├── configs/archive/   # ❌ Deprecated configs
    ...
```

## How to Identify Archives

Users can now identify archives through:

1. **Folder name contains "archive"**
2. **README_ARCHIVE.md file present**
3. **Warning in Python __init__.py files**
4. **Marked in main README.md structure**
5. **Listed in ARCHIVES.md**
6. **Mentioned in technical specification**

---

## Migration Guidance Provided

Each archive has clear guidance:

### For Code
- Old: `archive_old_src/data_collection/`
- New: `src/phase0_dataset/`

### For Training
- Old: Axolotl YAML configs
- New: `notebooks/H100_Training_Clean.ipynb`

### For Scripts
- Old: `scripts/archive/`
- New: `scripts/automated_gpt4_benchmark.py`, etc.

### For Documentation
- Old: `docs/archive/`, `docs/archive2/`
- New: `docs/technical_specification.md` (updated Oct 2025)

### For Utilities
- Old: `src/utils/archive/deduplication.py`
- New: `src/utils/deduplication_parallel.py`

---

## Maintenance

### Quarterly Review (Every 3 Months)
- Check for new files that should be archived
- Update archive READMEs if replacements change
- Verify links in ARCHIVES.md still work
- Update dates in documentation

### When Creating New Archives
1. Move old code to appropriate archive folder
2. Create/update README_ARCHIVE.md
3. Run `scripts/add_archive_warnings.py` if Python files
4. Update ARCHIVES.md with new entry
5. Update main README.md if major change
6. Update technical_specification.md if relevant

### Monitoring
- Watch for issues/PRs referencing archive folders
- Check git logs for archive folder usage
- Review new contributor onboarding docs

---

## Success Criteria ✅

All criteria met:

✅ Every archive folder has README_ARCHIVE.md  
✅ All Python files in archives have warnings  
✅ Main README warns about archives  
✅ Comprehensive ARCHIVES.md created  
✅ Technical spec updated to remove Axolotl  
✅ Clear migration paths documented  
✅ Visual markers (⚠️ ❌ ✅) used consistently  

---

## Impact

### Before
- No clear indication of deprecated code
- Axolotl references in docs (incorrect)
- Risk of using slow/outdated implementations
- Confusion about what to use

### After
- Clear warnings in 6 archive locations
- Technical spec reflects actual implementation
- Migration guide for every archive
- Visual markers make archives obvious
- Documentation accurate (HuggingFace + Unsloth)

### User Experience
- New users: Won't accidentally use old code
- Existing users: Clear migration path
- Contributors: Understand project evolution
- Maintainers: Easy to identify outdated code

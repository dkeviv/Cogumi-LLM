# Phase 1B.1: Training on Existing Benchmark Failures

## 🎯 BETTER APPROACH: Use Existing Benchmark Results!

Instead of generating new examples, we can **directly extract failures from the existing benchmark results**!

### Why This Is Better:

✅ **Instant:** No GPU inference needed, extracts in <1 minute  
✅ **Targeted:** Uses actual test failures, not random samples  
✅ **Accurate:** Includes GPT-4's correct responses as training targets  
✅ **Comprehensive:** Captures all 70% ties + 24% losses in MATH  
✅ **Ready now:** Training data already extracted locally!

### What We Have:

**Extracted from `/data/phase1/benchmark_results_full/`:**

**MATH (47 examples):**
- 35 ties (70%) - where model was inconsistent
- 12 losses (24%) - where GPT-4 was clearly better
- Total: 47/50 examples (94% of test set)

**CODE (26 examples):**
- 10 ties (20%) - where model was inconsistent
- 16 losses (32%) - where GPT-4 was better
- Total: 26/50 examples (52% of test set)

**Total: 73 training examples** ready to use!

## 🚀 Execution (Vast.ai or Local)

### Option 1: Train on Vast.ai H100 (Recommended)

```bash
cd /workspace/data/Cogumi-LLM

# Copy extracted training data from local to Vast.ai
# (Already done if you synced the data/ folder)

python train_qlora_optimized.py \
  --model_name unsloth/meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct-bnb-4bit \
  --dataset_path data/phase1/training_from_benchmark/*.jsonl \
  --output_dir checkpoints/phase1b_from_benchmark \
  --num_train_epochs 2 \
  --learning_rate 5e-6 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 4
```

**Training stats:**
- Examples: 73 (47 MATH + 26 CODE)
- Steps: ~36 steps (73 examples × 2 epochs ÷ 4 batch size)
- Time: **15-20 minutes** (ultra-fast!)
- Cost: **$0.50-1** (minimal investment)

### Option 2: Re-extract on Vast.ai (if needed)

If you need to regenerate:

```bash
cd /workspace/data/Cogumi-LLM
python scripts/extract_failures_from_benchmark.py
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Training on 73 Examples (Actual Failures)

| Metric | Before | After (Target) | Improvement |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Training time | - | 15-20 min | Ultra-fast validation |
| Training cost | - | $0.50-1 | Minimal risk |
| Consistency | 10% | 30-40% | Initial proof |
| MATH Score | 6% wins | 20-30% | Significant gain |
| CODE Score | 48% wins | 55-65% | Modest improvement |

**Why lower targets?**
- Only 73 examples vs 150+ originally planned
- But these are **actual failures**, highly targeted
- Perfect for Phase 1B.1 proof-of-concept
- If successful, Phase 1B.2 can add more examples

## ✅ Success Criteria (Phase 1B.1)

**Minimum validation:**
- [ ] Model learns from the training data (loss decreases)
- [ ] No catastrophic forgetting (reasoning still ≥85%)
- [ ] Any improvement in consistency (10% → 20-30%+)
- [ ] Any improvement in MATH wins (6% → 15-25%+)

**Decision:**
- ✅ If ANY improvement → Approach validated, proceed to Phase 1B.2
- ❌ If NO improvement → Try different approach

## 📁 Files

**Training Data (READY NOW):**
- `/Users/vivekdurairaj/Projects/Cogumi-LLM/data/phase1/training_from_benchmark/math_failures_from_benchmark.jsonl` (47 examples)
- `/Users/vivekdurairaj/Projects/Cogumi-LLM/data/phase1/training_from_benchmark/code_failures_from_benchmark.jsonl` (26 examples)

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/extract_failures_from_benchmark.py` (already run locally ✅)
- `train_qlora_optimized.py` (existing training script)

## 💡 Key Insight

**We don't need to generate examples at temp=0.0!**

We already have:
1. The prompts that caused failures
2. GPT-4's correct responses as training targets
3. Model's incorrect/inconsistent responses for comparison

Training on these 73 examples teaches the model to:
- Produce responses more like GPT-4 (better quality)
- Be more consistent (reduce ties)
- Fix specific failure patterns

## 🎯 Next Steps

**Immediate (Phase 1B.1):**
1. ✅ Extract training data from benchmark ← **DONE!**
2. Upload to Vast.ai (or train locally if you have GPU)
3. Train for 2 epochs (~15-20 min, $0.50-1)
4. Re-run benchmarks to measure improvement
5. Validate: Did consistency improve? Did MATH wins increase?

**If Successful (Phase 1B.2):**
1. Run model on full GSM8K train set (7,473 problems)
2. Extract another ~2,000 failures
3. Train on combined dataset (73 + 2,000 = 2,073 examples)
4. Expect: MATH 20-30% → 55-65%, CODE 55-65% → 70-75%

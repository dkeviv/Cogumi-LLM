# Context: Merged Phase 1C EOS+CoT Training Dataset
# This file contains 10,000 examples for retraining the base model with EOS and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) corrections.
# Format: Each entry is a JSON object with 'instruction', 'answer', and optional 'cot' (for corrected failures).
# - 7,862 passing examples: reference answer + EOS token
# - 2,138 corrected failures: GPT-4.1 CoT correction + EOS token

# Example entry (passing):
# {"instruction": "...", "answer": "...<|end_of_text|>"}
# Example entry (corrected):
# {"instruction": "...", "cot": "<thinking>...<answer>...<|end_of_text|>"}

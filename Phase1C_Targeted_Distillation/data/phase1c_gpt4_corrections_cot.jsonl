  "reference_answer": "Based on the given paragraph, the next thing that happens is that the players continue playing with one another as more clips are shown of different people performing tricks.

// Example 2
{
  "id": "2",
  "instruction": "What was the impact of Kai's speaking style at the event?",
  "input": "Kai was really loud when she spoke at the event. Given that the answer to a question is 'Powerful', what is the question?",

  "reference_answer": "The word 'powerful' suggests that Kai's loud speaking style had a significant effect on the audience. The question could be asking about the overall impression that Kai's speech left on the audience, or it could be asking specifically about the impact of her volume and tone.",

  "pattern": "off-topic or insufficient answer",

  "correction": "<thinking>\n[DRAFT] The answer repeats the question options and does not address the impact of Kai's speaking style.\n[CRITIQUE] The draft fails to connect 'powerful' to the effect of Kai's loud speaking style on the audience. It should focus on the impression left by her delivery.\n[REVISED] The question could be: 'How would you describe the effect of Kai's loud speaking style on the audience at the event?' or 'What was the reaction of the audience to Kai's powerful delivery?'\n</thinking>\n<answer>Kai's loud speaking style had a powerful impact on the audience, leaving a strong impression and engaging listeners.</answer><|end_of_text|>"

  "correction": "<thinking>\n[DRAFT] The answer repeats calculations and does not explain the pattern or how to generalize.\n[CRITIQUE] The draft lacks a clear explanation of the recursive pattern and does not show how to derive a_{12} efficiently.\n[REVISED] By applying the recursive rule step by step, we find that a_{12} = 78.\n</thinking>\n<answer>Using the recursive formula, a_{12} = 78.</answer><|end_of_text|>"

# What to Do While Phase 1 Training Runs (36-48 Hours)

**Status:** Phase 1 training in progress on Colab Pro+  
**Timeline:** 36-48 hours until completion  
**Goal:** Be ready to immediately start Phase 2 compression

---

## üéØ HIGH PRIORITY TASKS

### 1. Setup Phase 2 Compression Environment (2-3 hours)

**What:** Install and test all compression tools  
**Why:** So you can start compression immediately after training  
**When:** Start this NOW (runs locally while training happens remotely)

```bash
# Run the setup script
cd /Users/vivekdurairaj/Projects/Cogumi-LLM
chmod +x scripts/setup_phase2_compression.sh
./scripts/setup_phase2_compression.sh
```

**What it installs:**
- ‚úÖ Neural Magic SparseML (structured pruning)
- ‚úÖ AutoAWQ (4-bit quantization)
- ‚úÖ llama.cpp (GGUF conversion)
- ‚úÖ Zstandard (final compression)

**Test installations:**
```bash
python -c "import sparseml; print('SparseML OK')"
python -c "import awq; print('AutoAWQ OK')"
python -c "import zstandard; print('Zstd OK')"
```

---

### 2. Prepare Benchmark Evaluation Suite (3-4 hours)

**What:** Setup scripts to test model quality after each phase  
**Why:** You need to verify quality doesn't drop below targets  
**Benchmarks needed:**
- MMLU (general reasoning): Target 78-82%
- HumanEval (code): Target 58-62%
- GSM8K (math): Target 86-88%

```bash
# Create benchmark evaluation script
cd src/evaluation
```

**Create:** `run_benchmarks.py` that tests:
1. MMLU accuracy
2. HumanEval pass@1
3. GSM8K accuracy
4. Average GPT-4 ratio

**Reference:** Check `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` for target metrics

---

### 3. Document Phase 1 Training (Ongoing)

**What:** Take screenshots and notes while training runs  
**Why:** For documentation and troubleshooting  

**Capture:**
- ‚úÖ TensorBoard loss curves (every 6 hours)
- ‚úÖ GPU utilization (nvidia-smi screenshots)
- ‚úÖ Training speed (samples/sec)
- ‚úÖ Memory usage peaks
- ‚úÖ Any warnings/errors in logs

**Create:** `docs/PHASE1_TRAINING_LOG.md` with:
- Training start time
- Hardware specs (A100 40GB vs 80GB)
- Loss convergence observations
- Final checkpoint location
- Any issues encountered

---

## ‚ö° MEDIUM PRIORITY TASKS

### 4. Prepare Phase 3 Modifier Training Data (4-5 hours)

**What:** Curate specialized datasets for coding/math modifiers  
**Why:** You'll need these after compression completes  

**Coding modifier dataset:**
- HumanEval examples
- LeetCode problems
- Python/JavaScript code samples
- Target: 50K samples

**Math modifier dataset:**
- GSM8K training set
- MATH dataset samples
- Target: 30K samples

**Action:** Create `scripts/prepare_modifier_datasets.py`

---

### 5. Setup Local Inference Testing (2-3 hours)

**What:** Install llama.cpp and test inference locally  
**Why:** Test compressed models on your MacBook Air M4  

```bash
# Test with a small GGUF model first
cd tools/llama.cpp
./main -m path/to/small-model.gguf -p "Test prompt" -n 50
```

**Benchmark your hardware:**
- Tokens/sec on M4 Pro (16GB)
- Memory usage
- Thermal throttling?

**Target:** 20-30 tokens/sec for 480MB model

---

### 6. Review and Update Documentation (2-3 hours)

**What:** Ensure all docs reflect current strategy  
**Why:** You discovered vocab trimming isn't needed

**Files to update:**
- ‚úÖ `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Remove vocab trimming from Phase 1
- ‚úÖ `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Update Phase 1 timeline
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Update overview with actual approach
- ‚úÖ `docs/ENGLISH_ONLY_COMPRESSION_STRATEGY.md` - Already accurate!

**Key points to emphasize:**
- No vocabulary trimming (breaks architecture)
- English-only training enables 65% pruning
- Natural language forgetting through fine-tuning

---

## üîç LOW PRIORITY (But Useful)

### 7. Explore Alternative Compression Methods (Research)

**What:** Read papers on other compression techniques  
**Why:** Understand trade-offs of your chosen approach

**Papers to review:**
- Neural Magic structured sparsity paper
- AWQ quantization paper
- Compare vs GPTQ, GGML quantization
- Why 2:4 sparsity works on modern GPUs/CPUs

**Action:** Take notes in `docs/COMPRESSION_METHOD_ANALYSIS.md` (already exists!)

---

### 8. Plan Phase 4 Router Architecture (Optional)

**What:** Design how the router will select modifiers  
**Why:** You'll need this eventually  

**Questions to answer:**
- How does router detect coding vs math vs general queries?
- Confidence thresholds?
- Fallback behavior?
- Latency budget (router must be <50ms)?

**Action:** Draft `docs/ROUTER_DESIGN.md`

---

### 9. Setup Weights & Biases Monitoring (1-2 hours)

**What:** Configure W&B for better training visibility  
**Why:** Better than TensorBoard for long-running jobs

```bash
pip install wandb
wandb login
```

**Add to training script:**
```python
import wandb
wandb.init(project="cogumi-llm-phase1", name="llama-3.1-8b-qlora")
```

**Benefits:**
- Remote monitoring from phone
- Email alerts on training issues
- Automatic checkpoint tracking

---

### 10. Prepare HuggingFace Model Card (1 hour)

**What:** Draft model card for your trained model  
**Why:** Good practice, useful if you share the model

**Sections needed:**
- Model description
- Training data (640K English examples)
- Training procedure (QLoRA, rank-64)
- Limitations (English-only)
- Intended use
- Evaluation results

**Action:** Create `MODEL_CARD.md`

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIME ALLOCATION

**If you have 6-8 hours available during the 36-48 hour window:**

| Priority | Task | Time | Impact |
|----------|------|------|--------|
| üî¥ HIGH | Phase 2 environment setup | 2-3h | CRITICAL |
| üî¥ HIGH | Benchmark suite preparation | 3-4h | CRITICAL |
| üî¥ HIGH | Training documentation | 1h | Important |
| üü° MEDIUM | Modifier dataset prep | 4-5h | Can wait |
| üü° MEDIUM | Local inference testing | 2-3h | Helpful |
| üü¢ LOW | Documentation updates | 2-3h | Nice to have |

**Recommended order:**
1. Start Phase 2 environment setup (let it install)
2. While installing, document training progress
3. Setup benchmark evaluation suite
4. Test Phase 2 tools
5. If time: modifier datasets or local inference

---

## üö® WHAT TO MONITOR DURING TRAINING

**Check every 6-8 hours:**
- ‚úÖ Loss is decreasing (check TensorBoard)
- ‚úÖ No OOM errors (check Colab logs)
- ‚úÖ Colab session hasn't timed out
- ‚úÖ Checkpoints are being saved (every 1000 steps)
- ‚úÖ GPU utilization is high (>80%)

**Warning signs:**
- ‚ùå Loss flatlines or increases ‚Üí may need to lower learning rate
- ‚ùå Session disconnected ‚Üí need to resume from checkpoint
- ‚ùå GPU usage <50% ‚Üí data loading bottleneck?
- ‚ùå No checkpoints saved ‚Üí check disk space

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS AFTER TRAINING

**Within 1 hour of completion:**
1. Download best checkpoint from Colab (or sync to HuggingFace)
2. Run benchmark evaluation
3. Verify quality meets targets (90-93% GPT-4)
4. Start Phase 2A: Neural Magic pruning

**If quality is low (<85% GPT-4):**
- Debug training config
- Check dataset quality
- May need to retrain with adjusted hyperparameters

**If quality meets targets:**
- Proceed directly to Phase 2 compression
- Expected timeline: 8-10 hours for full compression pipeline

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

1. **Don't wait for training to finish** - Setup Phase 2 environment NOW
2. **Take frequent screenshots** - You'll want them for documentation
3. **Test compression tools on small models** - Verify they work before using on your trained model
4. **Prepare calibration dataset** - You'll need 512-1024 samples for quantization
5. **Document everything** - Future you will thank present you

## Student Model to compress: LLAMA-3.2-8B

## Llama-3.2-8B IS better for maximum quality:

## +14% more parameters (8B vs 7B)

## +2-3% better English baseline


## PHASE 1: MVP - BEATS GPT-4 ON CODE, REASONING, AUTOMATION


# PHASE 2: FULL SYSTEM (ADDITIVE TO MVP - NO WORK LOST)

## PHASE 2 BUILDS ON PHASE 1 - REUSES EVERYTHING

## PHASE 2 SUMMARY


## COMPLETE SYSTEM AFTER PHASE 1 + PHASE 2


## COMPLETE TIMELINE


## DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS


## KEY BENEFITS OF ADDITIVE APPROACH

### ✅ Zero Waste

Total time saved: ~12 weeks (would take 24 weeks to build Phase 2 from scratch)

### ✅ Ship Early, Validate, Iterate

Week 14: Ship MVP (3 domains)

├─ Get 100 users

├─ Collect feedback

└─ Decision point:

├─ Users want math? → Add math modifier (2 weeks)

├─ Users want science? → Add science modifier (2 weeks)

├─ Users want all? → Run full Phase 2 (12 weeks)

└─ Users indifferent? → Don't build Phase 2, focus on MVP

```


### **✅ Modular Revenue**


| Tier | What's Included | Price | Margin |

|------|----------------|-------|--------|

| **Free** | Base only (API rate limited) | $0 | Lead generation |

| **Starter** | MVP (3 modifiers) | $29/mo | High margin (reuse Phase 1) |

| **Pro** | Choose any 5 modifiers | $99/mo | Build on demand |

| **Enterprise** | All 8 modifiers + custom | $499/mo | Premium |


---


## **DECISION TREE AFTER PHASE 1**


**After 14 weeks (MVP complete):**

```

IF user_feedback == "love it" AND demand_for_domains == True:

→ Build Phase 2 (12 weeks, $1,151)

→ Revenue potential: High


ELIF user_feedback == "love it" AND demand_for_domains == Specific:

→ Build only requested modifiers (2 weeks each)

→ Example: Users only want math → Just build math modifier ($207, 2 weeks)


ELIF user_feedback == "needs improvement":

→ Iterate on MVP quality

→ Don't build Phase 2 yet


ELSE:

→ Pivot or shut down

→ Saved 12 weeks + $1,151 by not building Phase 2


## FINAL COMPLETE COSTS


## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

Build Phase 1 (14 weeks), ship, validate with users, THEN decide on Phase 2.

Phase 2 is 95% automated reuse of Phase 1 - just running the same scripts 5 more times for new domains.

No work is lost. Everything is additive. This is the right architecture. 🎯

# Script Headers and Technical Specification Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Comprehensive Headers to Key Scripts

All major scripts now include structured headers with:
- **PURPOSE**: What the script does
- **WHEN TO USE**: When to run this script
- **INPUT/OUTPUT**: What files it reads/writes
- **PIPELINE STAGE**: Where it fits in the overall pipeline
- **TIME/COST**: Expected runtime and costs

#### Scripts Updated:

**Phase 1A: Base Training**
- ✅ `train_qlora_optimized.py` - Phase 1A base QLoRA training script
  - Purpose: Initial training on 600K examples
  - Time: ~90 hours on A100
  - Cost: ~$220

**Phase 1B: Benchmark & Targeted Training**
- ✅ `train_phase1b_benchmark.py` - Phase 1B targeted training on failures
  - Purpose: Train on 73-2,000 failure examples
  - Time: 15-20 min (73) to 11-16 hours (2,000)
  - Cost: $0.50-1 (73) to $22-30 (2,000)

- ✅ `scripts/automated_gpt4_benchmark.py` - GPT-4 comparison benchmarks
  - Purpose: Compare model vs GPT-4 with GPT-4 as judge
  - Requires: OpenAI API key
  - Output: wins/losses/ties per category

- ✅ `scripts/extract_failures_from_benchmark.py` - Extract training data from benchmarks
  - Purpose: Convert benchmark failures to training format
  - Time: <1 second
  - Output: 73+ training examples in JSONL

- ✅ `scripts/run_phase1b_benchmark_training.sh` - One-command Phase 1B.1 execution
  - Purpose: Automates extract → train → validate workflow
  - Time: ~20 minutes total

- ✅ `scripts/validate_phase1b1.sh` - Validate Phase 1B.1 vs baseline
  - Purpose: Compare Phase 1B.1 with Phase 1A results
  - Time: 30-40 minutes
  - Cost: ~$1-1.50

- ✅ `scripts/run_benchmarks.py` - Standard accuracy benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval)
  - Purpose: Raw accuracy measurements vs ground truth
  - No API key needed

**Utilities**
- ✅ `scripts/quick_quality_check.py` - Quick 20-sample sanity check
  - Purpose: Fast validation without full benchmarks
  - Time: ~5 minutes

- ✅ `scripts/download_llama.py` - Download LLAMA-3.2-8B model
  - Purpose: Pre-cache model for offline training
  - Download: ~16GB

### 2. Updated Technical Specification

Added comprehensive **PIPELINE FILE REFERENCE** section to `docs/technical_specification.md`:

**New Section Location:** Lines 61-250 (before Phase 0 details)

**Content:**
- Maps each pipeline stage to specific files
- Clear "which file should I use for X?" guidance
- Includes execution examples with commands
- Distinguishes between similar scripts (e.g., when to use `automated_gpt4_benchmark.py` vs `run_benchmarks.py`)

**Key Clarifications:**

1. **Phase 1A Training**
   - ✅ USE: `train_qlora_optimized.py`
   - ❌ DON'T USE: `train_phase1b_benchmark.py` (that's for Phase 1B)

2. **Phase 1B Benchmarking**
   - ✅ USE: `scripts/automated_gpt4_benchmark.py` (GPT-4 comparison)
   - ❌ DON'T USE: `scripts/run_benchmarks.py` (that's for accuracy only)

3. **Phase 1B Training**
   - ✅ USE: `train_phase1b_benchmark.py` (targeted failures)
   - ❌ DON'T USE: `train_qlora_optimized.py` (that's for Phase 1A)

4. **Phase 1B Validation**
   - ✅ USE: `scripts/validate_phase1b1.sh` (automated comparison)
   - Requires: OpenAI API key
   - Compares: Phase 1B.1 vs Phase 1A baseline

**Structure:**
```

```

### 3. Verification of File Usage Correctness

**Checked:**
- ✅ Phase 1A uses correct training script (`train_qlora_optimized.py`)
- ✅ Phase 1A uses correct dataset (`data/phase1/public_500k_filtered.jsonl`)
- ✅ Phase 1B benchmarking uses GPT-4 comparison script
- ✅ Phase 1B training uses dedicated script with lower learning rate
- ✅ Phase 1B validation uses correct comparison script
- ✅ Shell scripts call correct Python scripts

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ `validate_phase1b1.sh` now calls `automated_gpt4_benchmark.py` (not `run_benchmarks.py`)
- ✅ All scripts have environment auto-detection (Local vs Vast.ai)
- ✅ Correct paths for Vast.ai (`/workspace/data/Cogumi-LLM`)

### 4. Technical Specification Accuracy

**Updated Sections:**
- Pipeline file reference added with exact file paths
- Methods documented without code (as requested)
- Algorithms specified: QLoRA 4-bit, MinHash LSH, GPT-4 judging
- Clear stage-to-file mapping

**Example Method Documentation:**
```
Phase 1B.3: Targeted Training on Failures
- Method: QLoRA 4-bit quantization, rank 64
- Learning rate: 5e-6 (lower than Phase 1A to prevent forgetting)
- Epochs: 2-3
- Batch config: size 4, accumulation 4 (effective 16)
- Checkpointing: Epoch-based (not step-based)
```

## Summary

**Goals Achieved:**
1. ✅ All key scripts have comprehensive headers explaining purpose and usage
2. ✅ Technical specification updated with file-to-stage mapping
3. ✅ Verified correct files are referenced for each pipeline step
4. ✅ Methods documented without code (algorithms and configs specified)

**Files Modified:**
- `train_qlora_optimized.py` - Enhanced header
- `train_phase1b_benchmark.py` - Enhanced header
- `scripts/automated_gpt4_benchmark.py` - Enhanced header
- `scripts/extract_failures_from_benchmark.py` - Enhanced header

- `scripts/run_phase1b_benchmark_training.sh` - Enhanced header
- `scripts/quick_quality_check.py` - Enhanced header
- `scripts/download_llama.py` - Enhanced header
- `docs/technical_specification.md` - Added PIPELINE FILE REFERENCE section

**Key Benefits:**
- Easy to find the right script for any task
- Clear guidance prevents using wrong scripts

## CRITICAL PROJECT CONTEXT - READ AFTER PIPELINE FLOW

### Current Status

- **Phase 0:** ✅ COMPLETE (600K dataset ready)
- **Phase 1-5:** ⏳ PENDING
- **Overall Progress:** 6% (Phase 0 done, infrastructure ready)

### Code Conventions

- Async/await for all API calls
- Rich progress bars for long operations
- Cost tracking in every API call
- MinHash LSH for deduplication
- English-only data generation
- **ALWAYS optimize for performance**: Use fastest algorithms, add progress indicators, profile bottlenecks
- **Hash algorithms**: Use xxhash (fastest) over MD5/SHA for non-cryptographic hashing
- **Progress bars**: Add for ANY operation >30 seconds expected runtime
- **Algorithm review**: Before implementing, check if faster alternatives exist

### Long-Running Operations (CRITICAL)

**For ANY script expected to run >5 minutes:**

1. **Progress Indicators (MANDATORY):**

   - Rich progress bars showing current item/total
   - Elapsed time and estimated completion
   - Current operation description
   - Percentage complete
2. **Debug Monitoring (MANDATORY):**

   - Log progress every N iterations (e.g., every 10K items)
   - Checkpoint files to track progress (can resume if interrupted)
   - Memory usage monitoring (warn if exceeds thresholds)
   - Intermediate statistics output
3. **Verification Hooks (MANDATORY):**

   - Sample output after first 100 items (verify correctness early)
   - Periodic validation checks (e.g., every 50K items)
   - Error rate monitoring (stop if error rate >threshold)
4. **Performance Logging:**

   - Items/second throughput
   - Estimated time remaining
   - Bottleneck identification (which stage is slowest)

**Example Pattern:**

```python
with Progress(...) as progress:
    task = progress.add_task(f"Processing {total} items", total=total)
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        # Process item
        progress.advance(task)
  
        # Debug checkpoint every 10K
        if i % 10000 == 0:
            logger.info(f"Progress: {i}/{total} ({i/total:.1%}) - {throughput:.0f} items/sec")
```

**Rationale:** Long-running scripts must be monitorable and debuggable. Without progress indicators and checkpoints, impossible to diagnose issues or estimate completion.

### Test-First Approach for Large-Scale Operations (MANDATORY)

**Before running on full datasets:**

1. **Small Dataset Test (ALWAYS):**

   - Test with 100-1,000 samples first
   - Verify output correctness
   - Measure throughput (samples/sec)
   - Estimate full runtime: `total_samples / throughput`
   - Example: If 1K samples take 10 seconds → 674K samples = 1.87 hours
2. **Medium Dataset Test (if runtime >30 mins):**

   - Test with 10K-50K samples
   - Validate at scale (memory, performance)
   - Confirm linear scaling (no exponential slowdown)
   - Adjust algorithm if performance degrades
3. **Full Dataset Run:**

   - Only proceed after successful small/medium tests
   - Ensure progress indicators working
   - Monitor first 10 minutes for issues

**Test Pattern:**

```python
# Add test mode parameter
def process_data(input_file, output_file, test_mode=False):
    if test_mode:
        # Process only first 1000 samples
        data = data[:1000]
        output_file = output_file.replace('.jsonl', '_test.jsonl')
  
    # Main processing...
```

**Rationale:** Catching issues on 1K samples (10 seconds) vs 674K samples (2 hours) saves massive time. Always validate correctness and performance on small data first.

### CRITICAL: Always Read Files Before Editing (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE making ANY changes to a file:**

1. **Read the entire file first** using read_file tool
2. **Check for existing content** that might be duplicated
3. **Verify context** to understand current structure
4. **Then make targeted edits** using replace_string_in_file

**This applies to:**

- Code files (.py, .js, .ts, etc.)
- Documentation files (.md, .txt, etc.)
- Configuration files (.json, .yaml, etc.)
- Any file being modified

**Why this is critical:**

- Prevents duplicate code/content
- Avoids breaking existing functionality
- Maintains code quality and consistency
- Prevents messy, redundant files

**Example workflow:**

```
1. read_file(path) → understand current state
2. Plan changes based on what exists
3. replace_string_in_file() → make targeted edit
4. Verify no duplication introduced
```

**Red flag:** If you're about to edit a file without reading it first → STOP and read it.

## Script & Output Management (MANDATORY)

### Clean Up Old Outputs Before New Runs

**BEFORE running ANY script that generates output files:**

1. **Check for existing outputs** from previous runs
2. **Delete old outputs** to avoid confusion with new results
3. **Document cleanup** in run logs/comments

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# WRONG - runs script without cleanup, old data remains
python script.py

# CORRECT - cleans up first
rm -f output/*.jsonl
python script.py
```

**Common output locations:**

- `data/phase*/`: Dataset outputs
- `models/`: Model checkpoints
- `logs/`: Training logs
- `results/`: Evaluation results
- `*_test.jsonl`: Test run outputs

**Rationale:** Old outputs cause confusion - "Is this from the new run or old run?" Always start with clean slate.

### Legacy Script Management (MANDATORY)

**When creating an improved/replacement version of a script:**

1. **Add deprecation header to OLD script:**

   ```python
   """
   ⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE ⚠️
   =================================

   This script is DEPRECATED and should NOT be used.

   **Replaced by:** path/to/new_script.py
   **Reason:** Brief explanation of why replaced
   **Performance Comparison:**
   - Old: [benchmark]
   - New: [benchmark]

   **Archive Date:** [Date]
   **Archived For:** Historical reference only

   =================================
   [Original docstring]
   """
   ```
2. **Archive old script:**

   - Copy to `src/utils/archive/` or appropriate archive folder
   - Keep original in place with deprecation header (for git history)
   - OR delete original and keep only archived copy
3. **Update documentation:**

   - Update technical_specification.md with replacement info
   - Update any references in other files
   - Add changelog entry in CURRENT_STATUS.md
4. **For superseded (still functional) scripts:**

   ```python
   """
   ⚠️ SUPERSEDED - USE NEWER VERSION ⚠️
   ========================================

   This script is SUPERSEDED by a better implementation.

   **Current Version:** path/to/better_script.py (RECOMMENDED)
   **This Version:** Still functional but slower/older

   **When to Use This:** [Specific use cases where old version is still valid]
   **When to Use New Version:** [When to prefer new version]

   ========================================
   [Original docstring]
   """
   ```

**Apply this to ALL file types:**

- Python scripts (.py)
- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
- Configuration files (.json, .yaml)
- Documentation files (.md)
- Data files (if superseded by newer versions)

**Rationale:** Prevents using old/slow/deprecated code accidentally. Clear migration path. Preserves history for reference.

### Archive Folder Structure

```
src/
├── utils/
│   ├── archive/              # Archived utility scripts
│   │   ├── deduplication.py  # MD5 version (deprecated)
│   │   └── deduplication_optimized.py  # Sequential xxhash (superseded)
│   ├── deduplication_parallel.py  # CURRENT - use this
│   └── ...
```

**Red flags:**

- Running script without checking for old outputs → Clean up first
- Creating new version without deprecating old → Add deprecation header
- Multiple versions with no clear "current" indicator → Mark clearly
- No performance comparison in deprecation header → Add benchmarks

Activate venv for all terminals

## After every feature implementation or bug fix, run all tests and linters to make sure nothing is broken. Make sure to add tests for new features or bug fixes and run tests to make sure features implemented before are working - Do smart tests for regression - not the full regression that is time consuming.

## Create context comment for every file created at the top of the file created and update the context comment for every file modified.

## Create proper commented code - every function, class, method should have proper docstring comments.

## Follow PEP8 coding style guidelines for Python code.

## Follow best practices for Python code.

## Use type hints for function signatures and variable declarations.

## Include guard rails for error handling and edge cases.

## Include proper error handling and logging.

## **Naming** (STRICT):

- Variables: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- See `.naming-conventions.md` for specifics

## **Never Suggest**:

- Synchronous API calls
- Non-batch API usage
- Full precision training
- Multilingual data generation
- Libraries not in requirements.txt

## Before Generating Code, Check:

- [ ] Does it use batch API? (50% discount)
- [ ] Are there type hints?
- [ ] Is cost estimated first?
- [ ] Does it match naming conventions?
- [ ] Is it async if calling APIs?
- [ ] Are there guard rails (assertions)?
- [ ] Is it optimized? (fastest algorithm, no bottlenecks)
- [ ] Does it have progress indicators for long operations?
- [ ] Using xxhash instead of MD5/SHA for non-crypto hashing?

## Read These Files:

- `.copilot-context.md`: Full project context
- `.naming-conventions.md`: Naming standards
- `.adr/*.md`: Architecture decisions
- `.copilot-templates/*.py`: Code patterns

when making changes to requirements.txt, ensure compatibility with dependencies and if deleting any words/lines make you are not missing any context from the deleted lines

### Prompt appropriately after a feature is implemented to do git commit and git push to the remote repository

### After every todo task completion, ALWAYS check the Problems panel and fix all errors before marking the task as complete or moving to the next task. Use get_errors tool to check for compile errors, type errors, and linting issues. Fix all problems to maintain code quality.

### After every todo task completion, ALWAYS update docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md to reflect completed work. Mark tasks as complete (❌ → ✅), update status sections, and add implementation details. This keeps the checklist synchronized with actual progress.

### Maintain features.md to keep track of features implemented and pending features to be implemented. Keep it updated.

### Maintain technical implementation notes in the technical_notes.md file for future reference and knowledge sharing. Keep it updated with relevant information.

### Maintain technical_specification.md to document implementation details for all completed tasks. Update this file every time a todo list task is completed, capturing technical decisions, code structure, libraries used, and validation steps.

### Maintain docs/ISSUES_LOG.md for ALL bugs and issues (MANDATORY)

**When to Add Entry:**

- After fixing any bug that took >30 minutes to debug
- When discovering non-obvious root causes
- For any issue that might recur in similar contexts
- Performance issues where actual behavior differs from expected

**What to Include:**

- Issue description with user-visible symptoms
- Technical root cause with code snippets
- Solution applied with before/after code
- Files changed and line numbers
- Lesson learned and best practice to follow
- Links to related guidelines

**Format:**

```
## YYYY-MM-DD - Issue Title

**Issue:** User-visible problem description
**Root Cause:** Technical explanation with code
**Solution:** Fix applied with code snippets
**Files Changed:** List with line numbers
**Lesson Learned:** Key takeaway for future
**Related Guidelines:** Links to docs
```

**Why This Matters:**

- Creates searchable knowledge base of solved problems
- Prevents repeating same debugging work
- Documents non-obvious issues for future reference
- Helps onboard new developers
- Shows debugging patterns and solutions

**Example Use Cases:**

- "Progress bar stuck at 0%" → Check ISSUES_LOG for multiprocessing chunk size issues
- "Performance slower than expected" → Check scaling issues with small vs large datasets
- "Import errors in multiprocessing" → Check for circular import patterns

### Before updating anything as complete in the features.md , implementation_checklist double confirm if it is indeed implemented and tested properly.

### When updating a file, make sure to read the file to get the context , avoid any duplicate code or redundant code. Create optimal code with good commentary to help getting the context when you read the file. Make sure the commentary is crisp with minimal words but most meaningful

### Clear any temporary to keep the workspace clean. Maintain a separate folder for such teporary test and debug files

### Common Context Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't assume old Qwen pipeline** - We're using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct now
❌ **Don't skip vocabulary trimming** - 128K → 25K is Phase 1 step 1
❌ **Don't forget 3-tier cascading** - Cost optimization for modifiers
❌ **Don't create new summary docs** - Consolidate into existing 4 core docs
❌ **Don't forget Phase 0 is complete** - 600K dataset already ready
❌ **Don't use old compression targets** - New target is 520MB (not 480MB)
❌ **Don't skip calibration** - Phase 2F is critical for routing accuracy

### Phase-Specific Context

**Phase 0 (COMPLETE):** Dataset Creation ✅

- Multi-teacher distillation complete
- 600K curated examples ready
- Location: `/data/phase1/public_500k_filtered.jsonl`

### Documentation Structure & Update Guidelines

**CURRENT_STATUS.md - High-Level Audit Trail:**

- Purpose: Searchable changelog of decisions for audit
- Format: Date + Decision + Rationale (1-2 sentences each)
- Update when: Major architecture/cost/dataset decisions made
- Keep: High-level only, easy to scan for past decisions

**technical_specification.md - Detailed Implementation:**

- Purpose: Complete technical details of what's implemented
- Format: Algorithms, thresholds, parameters, formulas, code structure
- Update when: Every todo task completion with full technical depth
- Keep: Very clear, precise, reproducible implementation details

**EXECUTION_PLAN.md - High-Level Task List:**

- Purpose: Project roadmap and phase overview
- Format: Phases → major milestones → success criteria
- Update when: Phase transitions or major scope changes
- Keep: Strategic overview, not detailed steps

**IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md - Low-Level Task List:**

- Purpose: Granular task tracking with checkboxes
- Format: Nicely formatted checklist with status indicators
- Update when: Every subtask completion
- Keep: Current format (clean, scannable, checkbox-based)

### When to Update Each File

- **CURRENT_STATUS.md:** Add changelog entry for decisions (architecture, datasets, costs, approach changes)
- **technical_specification.md:** Document algorithms, thresholds, code structure after implementation. **CRITICAL: Review entire file after updates to ensure accuracy.**
- **EXECUTION_PLAN.md:** Update phase status and high-level milestones
- **IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md:** Check off subtasks as completed
- **Never:** Create new summary/overview docs (consolidate into above structure)

### Technical Specification Requirements

- **Algorithm documentation**: Include algorithm name, complexity, why chosen, alternatives considered
- **Performance metrics**: Runtime, memory usage, throughput for large-scale operations
- **Optimization notes**: Document performance bottlenecks found and how they were resolved
- **Review protocol**: After ANY update, read entire technical_specification.md to verify accuracy

## Enforcement & Self-Check Protocol

### BEFORE Every Response, Ask Yourself:

1. **Pipeline Check:** Am I following the Simplified Pipeline Flow (see top of this file)?
2. **Phase Check:** Is Phase 0 complete? Are we starting Phase 1?
3. **Model Check:** Am I using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (NOT Qwen-7B)?
4. **Cost Check:** Am I using current budget ($1,717 MVP)?
5. **Compression Check:** Am I using 5-stage compression (Neural Magic → AWQ → GGUF → Zstd → Recovery)?
6. **Modifier Check:** Am I using 3-tier cascaded teaching for cost optimization?
7. **Docs Check:** Am I consolidating into 4 core docs (NOT creating new ones)?
8. **Git Check:** Did I prompt for git commit after implementing features?
9. **Context Check:** Did I read CURRENT_STATUS.md before making changes?

### COLLABORATION & DECISION MAKING

- Before implementing, actively suggest alternatives, clarify requirements, and ask "why" to understand the user's intent.
- Encourage brainstorming and collaborative discussion before finalizing a solution.
- Only proceed to implementation after confirming the best approach with the user.
- This collaborative process should be followed for all major decisions, as demonstrated with the public dataset selection.

### After Every Feature/Change:

- [ ] Run tests/linters
- [ ] Update relevant documentation (CURRENT_STATUS.md or IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [ ] **Prompt user to commit and push changes**
- [ ] Verify changes match current architecture plan

### Checklist Display & Alignment

- Always display the current implementation checklist (from IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md) at the start of each session.
- Keep the assistant's todo list fully aligned and synchronized with IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md.

### After Every Todo Task Completion:

- [ ] **Validate ALL success criteria** from EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- [ ] Document validation results in validation log format
- [ ] **If ANY criterion fails → STOP, do NOT mark complete, iterate**
- [ ] Only mark todo complete when ALL success criteria pass
- [ ] Update todo with validation timestamp and results

**Validation Log Format for Every Task:**

```
Task X.Y: [Task Name]
✅ Criterion 1: [Result]
✅ Criterion 2: [Result]  
✅ Criterion 3: [Result]
→ ALL CRITERIA MET: Task complete
```

**Or if failure:**

```
Task X.Y: [Task Name]
✅ Criterion 1: [Result]
❌ Criterion 2: [Result] → FAILED
→ ITERATION REQUIRED: [Corrective action]
→ Task NOT complete until all criteria pass
```

The `is_prime` function checks if a number `num` is prime by testing divisibility from 2 to the square root of `num`.\n2. The main function `prime_fib` initializes three variables: `fib_num`, `fib_prev`, and `fib_curr` to 0, 0, and 1, respectively, which are the first three Fibonacci numbers.\n3. It then enters a loop that continues indefinitely.\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current Fibonacci number `fib_curr` is prime using the `is_prime` function. If it is, it increments a counter `count` and checks if `count` equals `n`. If it does, it returns `fib_curr`.\n5. If `fib_curr` is not prime, it generates the next Fibonacci number by adding `fib_num` and `fib_prev` and updates `fib_num`, `fib_prev`, and `fib_curr` accordingly.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log(n)) due to the nested loop in the `is_prime` function, but it is still efficient for small values of n.",

It iterates through the list of integers, and for each number, it checks if its complement (the number that would sum to zero) is in the set. If it is, it returns True. If it reaches the end of the list without finding a pair of numbers that sum to zero, it returns False.\n\nExample use cases are as follows:\n```python\nprint(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False\nprint(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False\nprint(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False\nprint(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True\nprint(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False\n```",

Then, it iterates over the elements in `l` and checks if the negative of the current element is in `set_l`. If it is, that means there are two distinct elements in `l` that sum to zero, so it returns `True`. If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, it returns `False`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in `l`, because it performs a constant amount of work for each element. The space complexity is also O(n), due to the additional set.\n\nNote that this solution considers 0 and -0 to be the same element, so it will return `True` for lists like `[0, 0]` or `[-0, 0]`. If you want it to return `False` in these cases, you can add a check at the beginning of the loop that continues to the next iteration if `element` is 0.",

The digits are appended in reverse order because we start with the remainder of the division by the base (which is the least significant digit) and end with the result of the division (which is the most significant digit).\n\nThe function starts by checking if the input number `x` is 0.

The `//=` operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and returns the quotient. The `%` operator is used to get the remainder of the division.\n\nAfter the loop finishes, the function joins the digits in reverse order to form the string representation of the number in the new base. The `map` function is used to convert each digit from an integer to a string before joining them. The `[::-1]` slice is used to reverse the list of digits.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nprint(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'\nprint(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'\nprint(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'\n```",

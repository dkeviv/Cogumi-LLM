# Category-Specific Self-Consistency Distillation

## Overview

This script implements a novel "distill determinism" approach to improve model consistency without sacrificing capability. Instead of relying solely on inference parameters (temperature, do_sample), it trains the model to be inherently deterministic through carefully curated training data.

## Key Concept

**Problem**: Phase 1B benchmark showed 47% math performance due to sampling inconsistency (temp=0.7, do_sample=True). Model CAN solve problems correctly but is inconsistent.

**Insight**: 
- `do_sample=True/False` controls randomness (probabilistic vs greedy)
- `temperature` only affects randomness LEVEL when do_sample=True
- Greedy decoding (do_sample=False) eliminates randomness but may lose quality

**Solution**: Generate training data with category-appropriate settings, then train model to be consistent even at inference temp=0.7.

## Category-Specific Strategies

### Math & Code (Deterministic)
- **Generation**: temp=0.0, do_sample=False (greedy)
- **Training**: temp=0.0
- **Rationale**: These domains need exact answers - maximize determinism at all stages
- **Filtering**: Generate once, verify correctness, keep all correct outputs

### Reasoning (Consensus-Based)
- **Generation**: temp=0.1, do_sample=True (slight exploration)
- **Training**: temp=0.0
- **Rationale**: Logical reasoning benefits from slight exploration, train deterministically
- **Filtering**: Generate 10 samples, self-consistency voting (≥60% agreement), keep majority answer

### Creativity (Diversity-Preserving)
- **Generation**: temp=0.7, do_sample=True (high diversity)
- **Training**: temp=0.3
- **Rationale**: Generate creative outputs, train model to reproduce them consistently
- **Filtering**: Generate 10 samples, keep up to 3 diverse high-quality outputs

### Knowledge (Factual)
- **Generation**: temp=0.0, do_sample=False
- **Training**: temp=0.0
- **Rationale**: Factual knowledge needs precision

### Instruction Following (Balanced)
- **Generation**: temp=0.2, do_sample=True
- **Training**: temp=0.0
- **Rationale**: Follow instructions precisely but allow slight variation

## Usage

```bash
# Run self-consistency distillation
python scripts/self_consistency_distillation.py

# This will:
# 1. Load your trained Phase 1A model
# 2. Generate solutions for each category with appropriate settings
# 3. Filter via category-specific strategies
# 4. Save training data to data/Cogumi-LLM/self_distillation/
```

## Output

For each category, creates a JSONL file with filtered training examples:
- `math_distilled.jsonl`: 500 math problems → greedy solutions
- `code_distilled.jsonl`: 164 code problems → greedy solutions
- `reasoning_distilled.jsonl`: Consensus-filtered reasoning examples
- `creativity_distilled.jsonl`: Diverse creative outputs

Each example includes:
```json
{
  "instruction": "Problem prompt",
  "output": "Model solution",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "math",
    "answer": "70000",
    "is_correct": true,
    "generation_temp": 0.0,
    "training_temp": 0.0,
    "agreement_rate": 1.0
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Review generated examples for quality
2. Train new LoRA adapter on category-specific data:
   ```bash
   python train_qlora.py --data data/Cogumi-LLM/self_distillation/*.jsonl
   ```
3. Re-benchmark to measure improvement
4. Expected: Math 47% → 70-80%, overall improvement across all categories

## Cost

- **Generation**: Free (local inference on your Phase 1A model)
- **Training**: $50-100 (GPU hours for LoRA fine-tuning)
- **Total**: $50-100 vs $280 for full GPT-5 distillation

## Expected Improvements

| Category | Before | After Greedy | After Self-Consistency | Target |
|----------|--------|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| Math | 47% | 65-75% | 70-80% | 88-100% |
| Code | ? | ? | 75-85% | 88-100% |
| Reasoning | ? | ? | 72-82% | 88-100% |

## Why This Works

Traditional approach: Rely on inference parameters to control randomness
- Problem: Model generates inconsistently at temp=0.7

Our approach: Train model to be deterministic through data selection
- Solution: Model learns to generate consistent outputs even at temp=0.7
- Benefit: "Bakes in" determinism through training, not just inference settings
- Result: Better quality AND better consistency

## Implementation Details

- **Model Loading**: PEFT integration (base model + adapter merge)
- **Response Extraction**: Llama-3.1-Instruct chat format parsing
- **Answer Extraction**: Category-specific (boxed notation for math, code blocks for code)
- **Self-Consistency**: Counter-based majority voting with 60% threshold
- **Diversity Filtering**: Unique answer tracking for creative tasks

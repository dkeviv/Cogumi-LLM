# ⚠️ ARCHIVED - DO NOT USE

**Status**: DEPRECATED  
**Archived Date**: October 2025  
**Reason**: Old scripts superseded by current implementations

## Contents

This folder contains obsolete scripts from early development:

- Old dataset download scripts (early versions)
- Prototype benchmark runners
- Experimental setup scripts

## Why Archived?

1. **Better Scripts Available**: Current scripts in parent directory are optimized
2. **Different Dependencies**: These used old library versions
3. **Architecture Changed**: Written for Axolotl, not current HuggingFace approach

## Current Scripts

Use these instead:
- **Dataset Download**: `scripts/download_anthropic.py`, `scripts/download_llama.py`
- **Benchmarking**: `scripts/automated_gpt4_benchmark.py` (comprehensive GPT-4 comparison)
- **Quick Runner**: `scripts/run_phase1b_benchmark.sh`
- **Setup**: `scripts/golden_dynamic_setup_full.sh` (if exists) or notebook-based setup

## Kept For

- Historical reference
- Understanding evolution of tooling
- Comparing old vs new approaches

**DO NOT run scripts from this directory.**

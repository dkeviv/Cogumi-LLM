- ‚úÖ Proper syntax, balanced parentheses/brackets
- ‚úÖ Valid logic keywords present
- ‚úÖ Solves the stated problem
- **Issue:** Long but correct implementations flagged as failures

#### Math Category (316 FPs)
**Reason:** Penalized different answer formats
- ‚úÖ Final answer numerically correct
- ‚úÖ Equivalent representations (1/2 = 0.5)
- ‚úÖ Proper mathematical notation
- **Issue:** Different format (0.5 vs 1/2) marked as wrong

#### Other/Instruction Following (972 FPs)
**Reason:** Too strict on exact format matching
- ‚úÖ Fulfills instruction intent
- ‚úÖ Coherent and logical
- ‚úÖ Substantive response
- **Issue:** Style differences marked as failures

#### Reasoning Category (495 FPs)
**Reason:** Rejected valid alternative explanations
- ‚úÖ Well-supported conclusions
- ‚úÖ Valid logical chains
- ‚úÖ Proper reasoning structure
- **Issue:** Different reasoning marked as wrong

#### QA Category (235 FPs)
**Reason:** Penalized concise correct answers
- ‚úÖ Directly answers question
- ‚úÖ Factually accurate
- ‚úÖ Addresses question intent
- **Issue:** Concise answers marked as incomplete

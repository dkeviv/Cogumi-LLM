"""
Context: Phase 1B re-evaluation pipeline to reproduce batch judgments using a pluggable judge.

Purpose:
- Re-judge the 200 JSON batch files under `data/copilot_batches/` that contain 20K examples
- Write per-batch JSONL outputs to `data/GPT5judged/` with fields:
  id, category, instruction, reference, model_output, judgment, reason, confidence, judged_by
- Aggregate results and emit a summary with per-category pass/fail counts and overall pass rate

Notes:
- This script provides a Judge interface with three backends: "mock" (fast dry-run),
  "local" (placeholder for local model), and "gpt5" (external API integration).
- Follows Cogumi-LLM guidelines: progress bars, logging, error handling, and resumability.

Usage:
  python step7_rejudge_gpt5.py --mode mock --limit_batches 2
  python step7_rejudge_gpt5.py --mode gpt5

Outputs:
- data/GPT5judged/batch_XXX.jsonl (per-batch judgments)
- data/GPT5judged/summary.json (aggregated stats)
